If you were able to figure out a portion of the text with some effort, open an issue (or change via a PR) that includes your thought process that helped you figure out the subject so other readers can benefit.

## Suggestions for improvement
Here are ways we look to make the text even more clear
- Add clarifying examples
- Add sentences that elaborate on harder to understand topic
- Add useful reminders for past information that allow the reader to keep less information in their short term memory, but not to the point of being excessively repetitive
- Add images and diagrams
- Math formulas should generally include a natural language translation unless the formula is easy to understand. We want the reader to be able to see the same concept from a few angles
- We generally want source code to be as short as possible -- but not to the point of taking significant effort to read
- Diagrams are generally helpful. If the diagram can be created with latex, that is the preferred way
- Adding headers or "visual structure" to the text that makes it easier for the reader to parse

Feel free to directly open a pull request with ways to suggest improvements to clarity, or open an issue if you aren't sure.

## Translations
Please reach out to us if you would like to create a translation. Translations should be kept in folders that match the ISO language code. For example, the Chinese translation of `abstract-algebra/en/abstract-algebra.md` should go in `abstract-algebra/zh/abstract-algebra.md`.
